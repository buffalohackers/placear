    <string name="about">Placear app is built off of the words Place and AR(Augmented Reality). Our goal is to build an augmented reality 
        for any android user in their own town/city. \n\nWe use your phone as an information source where you can literally just point your phone and get information. You can view the area around you 
        by using your camera and pointing at the desired location. We then display information about that building for you to view. You can 
        even interact with that information and see more. \n\nPress and hold the screen to view the top bar and tap to hide.</string>
